<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/01/14/doctors-scientists-petition-spotify-to-stop-joe-rogan-experience-covid-19-misinformation/?sh=270c9ce968fc">doctors calling on Spotify to stop Joe Rogan Experience misinformation</a>,
I wanted to see what his remarks were and what the risk really was.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Rogan said he did not think young and healthy individuals (specifically a 21 year old)
needed to get vaccinated. A rough point estimate of total deaths for individuals aged 0-24,
without pre-existing conditions, in England and Wales
during March to June 2020 is <strong>15</strong>. Data is severely lacking.</p>
</div>
<div id="joes-remarks" class="section level2">
<h2>Joe’s Remarks</h2>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re like 21 years old, and you say to me, ‘Should I get vaccinated?’ I’ll go, ‘No.’”</p>
<p>Joe Rogan</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe they’re safe and I encourage many people to take them. I just
don’t think that if you’re a young healthy person that you need it.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="target-of-inquiry" class="section level2">
<h2>Target of Inquiry</h2>
<p>Joe is clearly focusing on young, healthy people.
We will use people <strong>under 25 without pre-existing conditions</strong>.</p>
<p>This will only focus on deaths within that category and will not focus on
deaths outside the category. This will be a question of individual and not
community health.</p>
<div id="data-sources" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>I found that the UK (specifically England and Wales) has better data sources
on deaths of people without pre-existing conditions broken down by age than the
USA.
<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/report-cdc-overcounts-millions-vaccinations-163009341.html">Also the USA’s CDC recently corrected its mistake of miscounting millions of vaccine doses.</a></p>
<p>The UK and USA also have a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/">relatively similar</a>
death rate per capita from Covid-19 as the USA, but
UK has an older median age (40.6 vs 38.5)
and a different racial and ethnic makeup than the USA.</p>

between March and June 2020 for people without prexisting conditions aged 0-44 was 101.</a></p>
<p>Notes:</p>

<p>For comparison this means 101 of the 37,641 Covid-19 deaths from
March to June 2020 occured in people under 44 without pre-existing conditions,
this is 0.268% of the deaths.</p>
</div>
<div id="section" class="section level3">
<h3>0-44?</h3>
<p>The only category for young people was ages 0-44,
while other age groups have 5 year intervals.
This is an unacceptably large range.
The UK’s median age is 40, so 0-44 is well over half of its population.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this means we need to estimate the number of deaths by comparing
the overall death rate by age group.</p>

<h3>Under 14</h3>
<p>For all individuals under 14 (with or without pre-existing conditions) there was 3 deaths total from March to June 2020, for approximately <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/281208/population-of-the-england-by-age-group/">10 million</a>
individuals. That is less than 1 per million per year. For comparison <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/lightning/victimdata.html">the risk
of being struck by lightning is roughly 1 in 500,000</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="making-assumptions-of-estimate-the-under-24-deaths" class="section level3">
<h3>Making assumptions of estimate the under 24 deaths</h3>
<p>We will assume that the proportion of deaths, by age, in the population aged 0-44 is
similar to the deaths (by age) of the 0-44 population without complications.
This is a problematic assumption as the rate of pre-existing complications
increases with age and there may be a interaction between age, pre-existing
conditions and death. For example younger aged deaths may be driven by
pre-existing conditions to a larger, lessor or similar extent. There are too
many unknowns here and the data is not given. It is a rough estimate.</p>
<p>Using this assumption for COVID-19 deaths from March to June 2020 for
individuals without pre-existing conditions gives <strong>15 deaths
for ages 0-24</strong>, which is about 0.04% or 1 in every 2500 deaths from COVID-19.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="summary-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Looking at England and Wales between March to June 2020,
roughly <strong>15 deaths</strong> occurred in individuals <strong>under 24
without pre-existing conditions</strong>
and <strong>3 deaths</strong> occurred in individuals <strong>under 14</strong> with or without pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>Data is severely lacking in younger age groups
and about individuals without pre-existing conditions.</p>
